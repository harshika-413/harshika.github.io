<p>Declaring a constant object does NOT make the objects properties unchangeable:</p>

<p id = "demo"></p>

<script>
  const car = {type:"skoda", model:"1000", color:"black"};
  car.color = "grey";

  car.owner = "harshika";

  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Car owner is " + car.color;
