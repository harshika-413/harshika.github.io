<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var answer1 = " hii alll" ;
var answer2 = "she is called 'harshika' ";
var answer3 = 'she is called "harshika"';

 document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = answer1 + "<br>"   + answer2 + "<br>" + answer3;
